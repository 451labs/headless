/**
 * Hooks!
 *
 * Lifecycle hooks are the backbone of how you can have complete control over the output of your site.
 * Hooks are enforced via the hookInterface 'contract' defined here:
        https://github.com/Elderjs/elderjs/blob/master/src/hookInterface/hookInterface.ts
 *
 * If you read the hookInterface spec closely you'll see that each defined hook gets specific 'props' along with which of those props is 'mutable'.
 *
 * If you're a fan of 'pure' functions in JS, mutating props will probably set off alarm bells in your head. Fear not, instead of burying
 * what is mutating things deep in your application, you'll know it is probably in this file.
 *
 * Also, to help keep mutation predictable each 'hook' limits which 'props' can be manipulated and where.
 *
